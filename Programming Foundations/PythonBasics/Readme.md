This is the code I have written when I was going through the course [The Complete Python Masterclass: Learn Python From Scratch](https://www.udemy.com/python-masterclass-course/learn/v4/overview)

This folder here contains tips on how to use various things in python that were explained in courses (1-9)

each of the program files have comments to further explain what I was trying to acheive and tricks to that easily in python.
